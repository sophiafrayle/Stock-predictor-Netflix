# Netflix Stock Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the stock price of Netflix using historical stock price data and machine learning techniques. By leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, we built a predictive model to forecast future stock prices, helping investors and analysts make informed decisions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Netflix-Stock-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Netflix-Stock-Prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run the `Netflix Stock prediction.ipynb` notebook.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Imported historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
   - Cleaned and processed the data using pandas.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created additional features such as moving averages and trading volumes.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented various machine learning models including Linear Regression and LSTM.
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
5. **Visualization**:
   - Plotted actual vs. predicted stock prices using matplotlib.

## Results
The project successfully predicted Netflix's stock prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The LSTM model showed the best performance with the lowest error metrics. Visualizations of the actual and predicted stock prices indicate the model's effectiveness in capturing the stock price trends.
